# Test Failures Analysis - Non-v0.2.0 Related

## Summary

Most test failures appear to be **unrelated to the v0.2.0 Pipeline Builder update**. They are primarily caused by:
1. Missing implementations (import errors)
2. API mismatches in existing code
3. Incorrect async context manager usage

## Test Failure Categories

### 1. Import Errors (Likely Pre-existing)
These tests fail because expected classes/functions are not implemented:

- **test_production.py**: Missing `Bulkhead` class
- **test_security.py**: Missing `AuditLogger` class  
- **test_ai_integration.py**: Missing `create_adaptive_brick` function
- **test_devtools.py & test_devtools_enhanced.py**: Missing `debug_pipeline` function (only `fuse_pipeline` exists)

### 2. ConnectionPool API Issues (Pre-existing)
The `ConnectionPool.acquire()` method returns an async context manager but tests expect a direct await:

```python
# Tests expect:
conn = await pool.acquire()

# But implementation likely returns:
async with pool.acquire() as conn:
    ...
```

Affected tests:
- `test_pool_lifecycle`
- `test_pool_max_size` 
- `test_pool_async_factory`

### 3. Registry/Version Tests (Possibly Pre-existing)
- `test_version_bump`: NameError suggesting missing imports/functions
- `test_create_package_from_brick`: Implementation mismatch
- `test_search_packages`: Assertion failure

### 4. Utility Function Issues
- `test_with_cache`: NameError
- `test_with_batching`: Implementation issue
- `test_get_system_metrics`: Missing dependency or implementation

### 5. Skill Registry Test
- `test_duplicate_registration`: Logic or assertion issue

## Conclusion

None of these failures appear to be caused by the v0.2.0 Pipeline Builder API addition or the pipe operator migration (| to >>). They all point to:

1. **Incomplete implementations** - Many expected classes/functions simply don't exist
2. **API mismatches** - The tests expect different signatures than what's implemented
3. **Missing dependencies** - Some system metrics functionality may require additional packages

The v0.2.0 update focused on adding the Pipeline Builder API and migrating pipe operators, which wouldn't affect these core implementation issues.
