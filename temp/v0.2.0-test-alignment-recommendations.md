# V0.2.0 Test Alignment Recommendations

## Analysis Against Framework Philosophy

Based on the Nanobricks principles (Simple, Standardized, Composable, Self-Sufficient, Scaffoldable), I've analyzed the failing tests and features:

### 1. **ConnectionPool** (performance.py)
**Verdict: REMOVE**
- Violates "Be Simple" - Connection pooling is infrastructure complexity
- Nanobricks should be stateless and atomic by design
- If resource pooling is needed, it should be managed externally or via a skill
- The async context manager pattern in tests is incorrect anyway

### 2. **Bulkhead Pattern** (production.py)
**Verdict: REMOVE TEST**
- The `CircuitBreaker` already provides resilience
- Bulkhead is an advanced isolation pattern that adds complexity
- Not aligned with "Simple" principle
- Could be added later as an optional advanced feature if truly needed

### 3. **AuditLogger** (security.py)
**Verdict: REMOVE TEST** 
- The module already has `InputSanitizer` which is more core
- Audit logging belongs in the observability skill, not security
- Tests are looking for a class that was never implemented

### 4. **create_adaptive_brick** (adaptive.py)
**Verdict: REMOVE TEST**
- Factory functions add unnecessary indirection
- Direct instantiation of `AdaptiveBrick` is clearer and simpler
- Aligns with "Be Simple" - no need for factory patterns

### 5. **debug_pipeline** (devtools.py)
**Verdict: REMOVE TEST**
- Function doesn't exist and isn't needed
- `BrickDebugger` class already provides debugging capabilities
- Tests are importing a non-existent function

### 6. **Utility Functions in performance.py**
**Verdict: FIX SELECTIVELY**
- `with_cache` and `with_batching` - These decorator utilities could be useful
- `get_system_metrics` - Fix by making psutil optional (already handled)

### 7. **Registry/Version Tests**
**Verdict: FIX**
- These seem important for the package registry feature
- Align with v0.2.0 goals for package distribution

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Remove Obsolete Tests
```bash
# Remove tests for unimplemented/unnecessary features
rm tests/test_production.py  # Or remove Bulkhead tests only
rm tests/test_security.py    # Or remove AuditLogger tests only
```

### 2. Fix Import Errors in Tests
```python
# In tests/unit/test_ai_integration.py
# Change: from nanobricks.adaptive import create_adaptive_brick
# To: from nanobricks.adaptive import AdaptiveBrick

# In tests/unit/test_devtools.py
# Remove: from .debugger import debug_pipeline
```

### 3. Fix ConnectionPool Tests or Remove Feature
**Option A: Remove ConnectionPool entirely** (Recommended)
- Delete ConnectionPool class from performance.py
- Remove related tests
- Simplifies the framework

**Option B: Fix the API mismatch**
```python
# Change tests from:
conn = await pool.acquire()

# To:
async with pool.acquire() as conn:
    ...
```

### 4. Focus v0.2.0 on Core Strengths

The v0.2.0 release should emphasize:
- ✅ Pipeline Builder API (already added)
- ✅ Pipe operator migration (>> instead of |)
- ✅ Core composition patterns
- ✅ Simple, reliable primitives

Not on:
- ❌ Complex infrastructure (connection pools)
- ❌ Advanced resilience patterns (bulkhead)
- ❌ Factory functions
- ❌ Features that were never implemented

## Principle-Driven Decision

Following "When principles conflict, simplicity wins":
- Remove features that add complexity without clear value
- Fix only what aligns with core framework goals
- Keep the framework lean and focused

This makes v0.2.0 a solid foundation that other packages can rely on, rather than a collection of half-implemented advanced features.
