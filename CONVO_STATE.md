I would like you to refine our dev docs:\

1. The section order should be as follows: Getting Started, Core Concepts,
   Building Systems, Cookbook, Advanced Topics\
2. Order within "Evolution": \

- Roadmap, \
- Concept Evovolution (becomes a subsection based on nested sections; see answer
  by your colleague below): consolidate `Project History`, `Concept Evolution`,
  `Nanobricks v1.0`, `Nanobricks v2.0` into appropriate sub pages\\

3. While you restructure the dev docs, always apply a "gardening perspective":
   what's obsolete/too lengthy, imprecise? Is the doc helpful and meaningful, is it
   actually in sync with the codebase? Etc.
4. THE BIG ONE: I like the "Cookbook" and "Building Systems" sections. However,
   I wonder if we could "do even better" regarding speaking directly to other
   coding agents in the sense of providing the "dev docs" in a AI model-centric
   manner, i.e. treating AI devs as "first class citizens". Ask yourself: you as
   Claude Code, what type of docs formatted in what way would YOU (!) as an AI
   coding agent would love to see to "just know exactly what's going on and how to
   leverage a software system"? Do a web search on this. Sometimes this seems also
   to be called "Model-First Development". Be really bold on this, go all in, this
   is YOUR chance to create a version of the nanobricks dev docs that is
   SPECIFICALLY tailored to you and your fellow AI coding agents. Just in case (!)
   you want to center this around "very good memories and instructions/prompts",
   maybe reason about how much it would make sense to apply jinja2 templates for
   that or if .qmd files are better/enough of if a combination of both makes sensen
   OR if there's even something WAY better out there. Search and reason
   EXTENSIVELY on this. \
   IMPORTANT THOUGH: whatever you come up with, DO NOT completely restructure the
   existing dev docs, rather add to it by a dedicated section that can have as many
   subsections as you'd like. You are also free to come up with a completely new
   "agentic dev docs" in a new subdirectory of @docs/ and create the docs based on
   quarto plus whatever you would like to use. Give me your reasoning and gameplan
   on this before actually starting to implement anything\
   \
   And here's the answer from your colleague on nested sections in quarto:\
   \
   <answer>\\
   I'll look at your Quarto directory structure and then search for information
   about nested sections in Quarto sidebars.
   Ran tool
   Read file: docs/quarto/\_quarto.yml
   Now let me do a web search to find specific information about nested sections in
   Quarto sidebars.
   Ran tool
   Based on my search and looking at your Quarto configuration, I have excellent
   news! **Yes, Quarto absolutely supports nested sections in sidebars!**

Looking at your current `_quarto.yml` configuration, you're already using a
basic nested structure, but Quarto supports much deeper nesting. Here's what I
found:

## Current Structure vs. What's Possible

Your current structure has one level of nesting:

```yaml
sidebar:
  contents:
    - section: "Getting Started" # Top level
      contents:
        - index.qmd # Items under section
        - quickstart.qmd
        - tutorial.qmd
```

But Quarto supports **arbitrarily deep nesting**! Here are some examples of what
you can do:

## Deep Nested Sections

```yaml
sidebar:
  contents:
    - section: "Getting Started"
      contents:
        - index.qmd
        - section: "Basic Tutorials" # Nested subsection
          contents:
            - quickstart.qmd
            - tutorial.qmd
            - section: "Advanced Tutorials" # Even deeper nesting
              contents:
                - advanced-tutorial.qmd
                - expert-tutorial.qmd
        - section: "Installation" # Another subsection
          contents:
            - installation.qmd
            - troubleshooting.qmd
```

## Key Features Available

1. **Multi-level nesting**: You can nest sections as deeply as needed
2. **Collapse control**: Use `collapse-level` to control which levels are
   expanded by default
3. **Section linking**: Sections can have their own landing pages with `href`
4. **Mixed content**: You can mix individual files and subsections at any level

## Recommended Improvements for Your Docs

Here are some specific suggestions for your current structure:

```yaml
sidebar:
  style: "docked"
  search: true
  collapse-level: 2 # Shows top 2 levels expanded by default
  contents:
    - section: "Getting Started"
      contents:
        - index.qmd
        - quickstart.qmd
        - section: "Task System"
          contents:
            - task-overview.qmd
            - task-system.qmd
            - task-reference.qmd
        - section: "Development Workflows"
          contents:
            - developer-workflows.qmd
            - distribution.qmd
    - section: "Cookbook"
      contents:
        - cookbook/index.qmd
        - section: "Basic Patterns"
          contents:
            - cookbook/basic-pipeline.qmd
            - cookbook/dependency-injection.qmd
        - section: "Advanced Patterns"
          contents:
            - cookbook/error-handling.qmd
            - cookbook/testing-bricks.qmd
            - cookbook/composition-patterns.qmd
    - section: "Core Concepts"
      contents:
        - section: "Architecture"
          contents:
            - architecture.qmd
            - architecture-diagrams.qmd
            - design-philosophy.qmd
            - principles.qmd
        - section: "Type System"
          contents:
            - type-safety.qmd
            - type-utilities.qmd
        - section: "Development Practices"
          contents:
            - naming-conventions.qmd
            - patterns.qmd
```

## Additional Configuration Options

You can also:

- Set `collapse-level: 3` to show more levels expanded by default
- Use `auto` generation for some sections: `contents: reports`
- Add section separators with `- text: "---"`
- Control which sidebar appears on which pages using sidebar IDs

The documentation shows that Quarto's sidebar system is very flexible and can
handle complex nested structures effectively!

 You can do this! Be SUPER bold - especially regarding task 4. But ALSO cautious
and super thoughtful to not break anything.\

‚è∫ Based on my research and analysis, here's my comprehensive reasoning and game

ü§ñ AI-Agent-Centric Documentation Strategy

Core Insights from Research

1. Model-First Development emphasizes:

   - Structured, predictable documentation formats
   - Clear context boundaries and explicit dependencies
   - Machine-parseable examples and patterns
   - Instruction-oriented rather than narrative-oriented content

2. What AI Agents Need Most:

   - Immediate Context: What is this? What does it do?
   - Clear Contracts: Inputs, outputs, side effects
   - Composition Patterns: How do I combine things?
   - Error Patterns: What can go wrong and how to handle it?
   - Working Examples: Copy-paste-modify patterns

3. Documentation Anti-patterns for AI:

   - Long narrative explanations
   - Implicit knowledge requirements
   - Examples that require human interpretation
   - Scattered information across multiple files

My Vision: "Agentic Dev Docs"

I propose creating a new docs/agentic/ directory with AI-first documentation
that treats AI coding agents as first-class citizens. This will complement (not
replace) the existing human-oriented docs.

Structure Design

Key Innovations

1. Structured Memory Format:
   {
   "concept": "Nanobrick",
   "definition": "Self-contained module implementing Runnable protocol",
   "required_methods": ["invoke", "invoke_sync", "__rshift__"],
   "type_parameters": ["T_in", "T_out", "T_deps"],
   "example_minimal": "class MyBrick(Nanobrick[str, int]): ...",
   "common_errors": ["Type mismatch in pipeline", "Missing async"],
   "related": ["Pipeline", "Skill", "Composition"]
   }
2. Task-Oriented Documentation:
   Instead of "Here's how Nanobricks work", we have:

   - "Create a validator nanobrick"
   - "Add API endpoint to existing nanobrick"
   - "Compose three nanobricks with error handling"

3. Contract-First Approach:
   nanobrick:
   protocol: NanobrickProtocol
   abstract_base: NanobrickBase
   required: - name: str - version: str - invoke(input: T_in, deps: T_deps) -> T_out
   optional: - description: str - metadata: dict
4. Jinja2 Templates for Consistency:
   Templates ensure every nanobrick/skill/pattern is documented identically, making
   it easier for AI agents to parse and understand.
5. Error Pattern Library:
   {
   "error": "TypeError: Pipeline type mismatch",
   "cause": "Output type of brick1 doesn't match input of brick2",
   "solution": "Use TypeAdapter or ensure type compatibility",
   "example_fix": "pipeline = brick1 >> TypeAdapter[Dict, List] >> brick2"
   }

Why This Approach?

1. Structured > Narrative: AI agents excel with structured data
2. Examples > Explanations: We learn by pattern matching
3. Contracts > Conventions: Explicit is better than implicit
4. Tasks > Topics: Goal-oriented documentation
5. Templates > Free-form: Consistency aids comprehension

Integration with Existing Docs

The agentic docs will:

- Link to human docs for detailed explanations
- Generate certain sections from code analysis
- Provide a complementary view, not a replacement
- Use Quarto for rendering but with structured data backends

Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Create directory structure and base templates
2. Phase 2: Extract core concepts into structured format
3. Phase 3: Build task-oriented pattern library
4. Phase 4: Create contract specifications
5. Phase 5: Integrate with Quarto build process

This approach treats AI agents as partners who need:

- Clear, structured information
- Copy-paste solutions
- Explicit contracts and types
- Task-focused guidance
- Error handling patterns

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this vision alongside the
restructuring of the existing dev docs?

## Research on AI-Centric Documentation (Claude Sonnet 3.5's Findings)

### Research Summary

After extensive research on Model-First Development and AI-centric documentation patterns, I've discovered several key insights that will inform our approach:

1. **Emerging Standards and Patterns**:

   - **llms.txt**: A proposed standard for providing LLM-friendly content at `/llms.txt` (similar to robots.txt)
   - **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Anthropic's open protocol for standardizing AI-data source connections
   - **JSON-LD**: Machine-readable structured data format widely adopted for AI consumption
   - **Agent-Computer Interfaces (ACI)**: Similar to HCI but optimized for AI agents

2. **Key Principles from Industry Leaders**:

   - **Anthropic's Building Effective Agents**: Emphasizes simple, composable patterns over complex frameworks
   - **Google's Structured Data**: Uses JSON-LD for AI-friendly documentation
   - **AWS Prompt Engineering**: Focuses on structured, predictable formats with clear contracts

3. **Documentation Anti-patterns for AI**:
   - Long narrative explanations
   - Implicit knowledge requirements
   - Examples requiring human interpretation
   - Scattered information across multiple files

### Refined Game Plan: "Agentic Dev Docs"

I propose an enhanced approach that builds upon the original vision while incorporating these industry best practices:

#### 1. Enhanced Structure

#### 2. Key Innovations Building on Original Vision

**A. llms.txt Integration**

```markdown
# Nanobricks

> Self-contained, composable modules implementing the Runnable protocol for building AI-powered pipelines.

## Core Concepts

- [Nanobrick Protocol](./contracts/interfaces/nanobrick.yaml): Base interface all bricks implement
- [Skill System](./contracts/interfaces/skills.yaml): AI capabilities as modular components
- [Type Safety](./memories/concepts.jsonld#type-system): Runtime and compile-time guarantees

## Tasks

- [Create a Nanobrick](./tasks/create-nanobrick/): Build your first brick
- [Compose Pipeline](./tasks/compose-pipeline/): Chain bricks together
- [Add AI Skill](./tasks/add-skill/): Integrate AI capabilities

## Optional

- [Advanced Patterns](./memories/patterns.jsonld): Complex composition strategies
- [Troubleshooting](./memories/troubleshooting.jsonld): Common issues and solutions
```

**B. JSON-LD Structured Memories**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "SoftwareSourceCode",
  "@id": "#Nanobrick",
  "name": "Nanobrick",
  "description": "Self-contained module implementing Runnable protocol",
  "programmingLanguage": "Python",
  "implements": {
    "@type": "Interface",
    "name": "Runnable",
    "methods": ["invoke", "invoke_sync", "__rshift__"]
  },

    "codeSampleType": "minimal",
    "text": "class MyBrick(Nanobrick[str, int]): ..."
  },
  "relatedConcepts": ["Pipeline", "Skill", "TypeAdapter"]
}
```

**C. Task-Oriented Structure with Context**

```json
{
  "task": "create-validator-nanobrick",
  "description": "Create a nanobrick that validates input data",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "prerequisites": ["understanding-nanobrick-protocol"],
  "context": {
    "imports": ["nanobricks.Nanobrick", "pydantic.BaseModel"],
    "patterns": ["input-validation", "error-handling"]
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "instruction": "Define your validation schema",
      "code": "class UserInput(BaseModel): ...",
      "explanation": "Pydantic model defines expected structure"
    }
  ],
  "success_criteria": ["Type-safe validation", "Clear error messages"]
}
```

**D. MCP Tool Definitions**

```json
{
  "name": "nanobrick_create",
  "description": "Generate a new nanobrick with specified type signature",
  "parameters": {
    "name": { "type": "string", "description": "Nanobrick class name" },
    "input_type": { "type": "string", "description": "Input type annotation" },

      "tests": { "type": "string" },
      "usage_example": { "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**

- Create directory structure and base schemas
- Implement llms.txt following the standard
- Set up JSON-LD schemas for core concepts
- Build task registry and first 3-5 tasks

**Phase 2: Knowledge Base (Week 2)**

- Convert existing concepts to JSON-LD format
- Create structured error pattern library
- Build composition pattern catalog
- Implement MCP tool definitions

**Phase 3: Generation & Optimization (Week 3)**

- Build Jinja2 templates for dynamic generation
- Create vector embeddings for semantic search
- Generate knowledge graph representation
- Implement llms-full.txt aggregation

**Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 4)**

- Test with multiple AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Create feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Build tooling for maintaining consistency
- Document meta-patterns for other projects

#### 4. Why This Approach Excels

1. **Standards-Based**: Leverages emerging standards (llms.txt, MCP, JSON-LD) ensuring compatibility
2. **Multi-Modal**: Supports different AI consumption patterns (direct reading, tool use, structured queries)
3. **Scalable**: Clear patterns for adding new content without restructuring
4. **Measurable**: Built-in success criteria and validation mechanisms
5. **Future-Proof**: Separates content from presentation, allowing format evolution

#### 5. Unique Value for AI Agents

- **Zero Ambiguity**: Every concept has a unique identifier and formal definition
- **Complete Context**: Task-based structure provides all needed information in one place
- **Machine-Verifiable**: Examples include expected outputs and success criteria
- **Tool-Ready**: MCP definitions allow direct integration with AI workflows
- **Semantic Richness**: JSON-LD enables knowledge graph traversal and reasoning

This enhanced approach maintains the boldness of the original vision while grounding it in proven industry practices and emerging standards. It creates a documentation system that truly treats AI agents as first-class citizens while remaining practical and maintainable.
