## Core Principles

The Nanobricks framework is built on ten fundamental principles that shape every design decision:

### 1. **Be Simple**
Complexity emerges from composition, not components. Each nanobrick should do one thing well, with a clear mental model that both humans and AIs can reason about effortlessly.

### 2. **Be Standardized**
One interface to rule them all. The consistent `invoke()` pattern and pipe operator create a universal language for composition.

### 3. **Be Composable**
Play well with others. Nanobricks combine like Lego blocks - any output can connect to any compatible input, creating endless possibilities.

### 4. **Be Self-Sufficient**
Carry what you need. Through skills, nanobricks bring their own batteries - but only activate them when needed.

### 5. **Be Scaffoldable**
Work out of the box. New nanobricks should be productive immediately, with sensible defaults and minimal configuration.

### 6. **Be Observable**
Show what you're doing. Built-in tracing, logging, and metrics make debugging a breeze, not a nightmare.

### 7. **Be Resilient**
Fail gracefully, recover automatically. Embrace the chaos of distributed systems with circuit breakers, retries, and fallbacks.

### 8. **Be Configurable**
Adapt without changing. TOML configuration allows behavior changes across environments without touching code.

### 9. **Be Evolutionary**
Improve over time. Through hot-swapping, versioning, and AI-powered adaptation, nanobricks get better with use.

### 10. **Be Secure**
Safe by default. Input validation, sandboxing, and the principle of least privilege are built into the foundation.

## Principle Hierarchy

### The Original Five (Core DNA)
1. Simple
2. Standardized
3. Composable
4. Batteries Included (Self-Sufficient)
5. Scaffoldable

These form the essential nature of what makes a nanobrick a nanobrick.

### The Extended Five (Distinguishing Features)
6. Observable
7. Resilient
8. Configurable
9. Evolutionary
10. Secure

These elevate nanobricks from simple components to production-ready, antifragile systems.

## Living by the Principles

### In Design
- Every new feature must support, not violate, these principles
- When principles conflict, simplicity wins
- The principles guide us toward antifragility

### In Implementation
```python
# Simple: One clear purpose
@nanobrick
class UppercaseTransformer:
    async def invoke(self, text: str) -> str:
        return text.upper()

# Composable: Works with others
pipeline = ValidateText() >> UppercaseTransformer() >> SaveToFile()

# Observable: Built-in visibility
transformer = UppercaseTransformer().with_skill("observability")

# Resilient: Handles failures
safe_transformer = UppercaseTransformer().with_fallback(lambda x: x)

# Configurable: Adapts to needs
config_aware = UppercaseTransformer(config="nanobrick.toml")
```

### In Evolution
The principles themselves can evolve, but only through community consensus and real-world validation. They are our constitution, not our chains.

## The Path to Antifragility

These ten principles, when followed together, create the conditions for antifragility:


- **Simplicity** enables understanding and adaptation
- **Standardization** allows universal composition
- **Composability** creates emergent complexity
- **Self-sufficiency** ensures independence
- **Scaffoldability** accelerates adoption
- **Observability** provides feedback loops
- **Resilience** handles stress gracefully
- **Configurability** enables runtime adaptation
- **Evolution** drives continuous improvement
- **Security** maintains system integrity

Together, they form a framework that doesn't just survive stress - it thrives on it.
