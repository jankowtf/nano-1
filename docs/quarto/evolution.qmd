## Version History

### v1.0 - Initial Concept (2025-01-22)

The original vision established five pillars:

1. **Simple** - Straightforward design and implementation
2. **Standardized** - Consistent interfaces 
3. **Composable** - Easy combination into complex components
4. **Batteries Included** - Self-contained functionality
5. **Scaffoldable** - Rails-inspired instant functionality

Key decisions:
- Every nanobrick as a Python package
- uv-based package management
- src-layout project structure
- Absolute imports

### v2.0 - Evolved Concept (2025-01-22)

Through sparring and critical analysis, several refinements emerged:

#### Major Changes

1. **Packaging Flexibility**
   - Not every nanobrick must be a package
   - Support for modules within projects
   - Nano-collections for themed groups

2. **Skills Replace Batteries**
   - Latent capabilities vs. heavy dependencies
   - Activate only when needed
   - Maintains simplicity principle

3. **Composition Patterns Clarified**
   - Pipeline composition (R-style)
   - Augmentation composition
   - Hybrid composition

4. **Architecture Levels**
   - Core Protocol (minimal)
   - Skilled (with capabilities)
   - Stateful (with memory/learning)

## Key Insights

### The Fundamental Tension
"How do we reconcile 'simple' with 'batteries included'?" 

**Resolution**: Skills as potential energy - capabilities that CAN be activated but don't add complexity unless used.

### The Composition Paradox
"When you pipe bricks together, what actually flows through?"

**Resolution**: Clear separation between data flow (through pipes) and capability enhancement (through skills).

### Nature as Guide
"It's both super complex and at the same time super simple"

This became our guiding principle - simple rules creating complex behaviors through emergence.

## Design Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-01-22 | Adopt skill model | Reduces complexity while maintaining power |
| 2025-01-22 | Support module-based bricks | Not everything needs to be a package |
| 2025-01-22 | Use pipe operator | Familiar from R, intuitive composition |
| 2025-01-22 | Type safety via beartype/mypy | Runtime + static checking |

## Future Evolution

The concept continues to evolve. Key areas for v3.0:
- Dynamic discovery mechanisms
- AI/Agent integration patterns
- Performance optimizations
- Real-world usage patterns
