## The Nature Metaphor

Nanobricks are the code equivalent of "antifragile nanobots" — atomic, self-sufficient components that gain strength from stress and compose organically into complex systems.

"Both super complex and super simple" - this guides our design:

- **Simple rules**: Minimal nanobrick interface
- **Complex emergence**: Rich behaviors from composition
- **Organic growth**: Start small, evolve naturally
- **Antifragility**: Learn and improve from stress

## The Five Pillars

### 1. **Simple**

- Designed for clarity and straightforward implementation
- Easy for both humans and AIs to reason about
- Single responsibility principle at the atomic level
- Minimal cognitive overhead

### 2. **Standardized**

- Consistent interfaces — the "Lego Connector Mechanism" for code
- Predictable behavior patterns
- Universal protocols for:
  - Input/Output contracts
  - Configuration management
  - Error handling
  - Lifecycle hooks

### 3. **Composable**

- Seamless integration patterns
- Pipeline-ready (can be chained/piped together)
- Supports multiple composition patterns:
  - Sequential (A → B → C)
  - Parallel (A + B + C)
  - Nested (A(B(C)))
  - Hybrid workflows

### 4. **Batteries Included**

Each nanobrick ships with modular, self-contained interfaces:

- **API Layer** (FastAPI) — RESTful endpoints auto-generated
- **CLI Layer** (Typer) — Command-line interface out of the box
- **Frontend Layer** (Streamlit) — UI components (app/page/tab/subtab)
- **Data Layer** (SQLModel) — Database interaction when needed

### 5. **Scaffoldable**

- Instant end-to-end functionality
- Rails-inspired convention over configuration
- Task-powered automation
- AI-friendly patterns for guided implementation
- Progressive enhancement model

## Key Design Patterns

### From Successful Frameworks

Based on analysis of successful frameworks like LangChain and PydanticAI, nanobricks leverages:

1. **Runnable Interface Pattern**
   - Standardized methods: `invoke()`, `batch()`, `stream()`
   - Enables uniform interaction across all components

2. **Composition Pattern with Pipe Operator**
   - Use `|` operator for intuitive chaining
   - Declarative pipeline construction

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Context-based dependency passing
   - Enhances testability and flexibility

4. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Clean, pythonic API for component configuration
   - Skills and capabilities as decorators

5. **Generic Programming**
   - Type-safe interfaces using Python generics
   - Compile-time type checking

## Antifragility Mechanisms

### 1. **Self-Healing**
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation
- Circuit breaker patterns

### 2. **Adaptation**
- Runtime configuration updates
- Dynamic scaling based on load
- Learning from failures

### 3. **Evolution**
- Version migration support
- Backward compatibility guarantees
- Progressive enhancement

## Type Safety Strategy

### The Challenge

When composing nanobricks with pipes (`A | B | C`), we need to ensure type safety where the output of A matches the input of B.

### The Solution

A hybrid approach combining:

1. **Static Analysis**: Python generics + mypy for development-time safety
2. **Runtime Validation**: Beartype for production runtime validation  
3. **Protocol Enforcement**: ABC + Protocol hybrid for interface guarantees

This provides the best of both worlds without over-engineering.

## AI Integration Philosophy

### Multi-Protocol Strategy

Nanobricks support multiple AI protocols as optional skills:

1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Primary
   - "USB-C for AI" - standardized tool/resource exposure
   - Client-server architecture perfect for nanobricks
   - Vendor-agnostic LLM support

2. **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** - Secondary
   - For nanobrick-to-nanobrick communication
   - Preserves agent opacity (privacy)
   - Enables multi-agent workflows

3. **AG-UI (Agent User Interaction)** - UI Layer
   - Event-driven protocol
   - Real-time state streaming
   - Human-in-the-loop support

This approach keeps AI capabilities optional while providing a clear path for enhancement.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Start Simple, Grow Organically

1. Define minimal viable interfaces
2. Build essential composition operators
3. Add skills progressively
4. Let patterns emerge from usage

### Convention Over Configuration

- Sensible defaults for everything
- Override only when needed
- Clear naming conventions
- Predictable project structure

### Developer Experience First

- Fast feedback loops
- Clear error messages
- Excellent documentation
- AI-friendly patterns

This philosophy prevents over-engineering while enabling powerful capabilities.
