# Reasoning on Key Design Decisions

## Type Safety for Composition

### The Challenge

When composing nanobricks with pipes (`A | B | C`), we need to ensure type safety where the output of A matches the input of B, etc.

### Solutions Discovered

1. **Beartype** - Runtime type checking with O(1) performance

   - Pros: Fast, works with existing hints, catches runtime errors
   - Cons: Only validates at runtime, not development time

2. **Mypy with Plugins** - Static analysis

   - Pros: Catches errors before runtime
   - Cons: Requires custom plugins for pipe operators

3. **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
   - Use both static (mypy) and runtime (beartype) checking
   - Create type-safe composition operators
   - Leverage Python's generics for type inference

### Decision

Start with standard Python generics + mypy for development-time safety. Add beartype for production runtime validation. This provides the best of both worlds without over-engineering.

## AI/LLM Integration

### The Vision

Nanobricks with reasoning capabilities - components that can think and adapt.

### Protocol Analysis (Updated)

After researching the current AI protocol landscape:

1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - PRIMARY CHOICE

   - "USB-C for AI" - standardized tool/resource exposure
   - Client-server architecture perfect for nanobricks
   - Vendor-agnostic LLM support
   - Growing ecosystem with Python SDK

2. **A2A (Agent-to-Agent by Google)** - SECONDARY

   - For nanobrick-to-nanobrick communication
   - Preserves agent opacity (privacy)
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 standard
   - Enables multi-agent workflows

3. **AG-UI (Agent User Interaction)** - UI LAYER

   - Event-driven protocol (16 event types)
   - Real-time state streaming
   - Perfect for Streamlit skill
   - Human-in-the-loop support

4. **ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)** - FALLBACK
   - Simple REST-based
   - No SDK required
   - Linux Foundation governance
   - Broad compatibility

### Decision

Implement a multi-protocol strategy:

- **Primary**: MCP for LLM integration (tool exposure)
- **Secondary**: A2A for agent collaboration
- **UI Layer**: AG-UI for interactive interfaces
- **Fallback**: ACP for REST compatibility

This approach provides maximum flexibility while maintaining the skill pattern - each protocol is a separate skill that can be activated independently.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: MCP Foundation

   - SkillMCP for tool exposure
   - Test with Claude and other LLMs
   - Document tool schemas

2. **Phase 2**: Multi-Protocol Support

   - Add SkillA2A for agent communication
   - Implement SkillAGUI for UI events
   - Create protocol bridges/adapters

3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Integration
   - Cross-protocol orchestration
   - Unified agent registry
   - Performance optimization

This approach keeps AI capabilities optional while providing a clear path for enhancement.

## The Nature Metaphor

"Both super complex and super simple" - this guides our design:

- **Simple rules**: Minimal nanobrick interface
- **Complex emergence**: Rich behaviors from composition
- **Organic growth**: Start small, evolve naturally
- **Antifragility**: Learn and improve from stress

This philosophy prevents over-engineering while enabling powerful capabilities.
