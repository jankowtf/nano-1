# LangChain

Based on the LangChain codebase context, you're asking about the design patterns used throughout the LangChain framework. Let me identify the key architectural and design patterns implemented in LangChain.

## Core Design Patterns in LangChain

LangChain implements several fundamental design patterns that enable its modular and composable architecture:

### 1. **Runnable Interface Pattern**

The most central pattern is the Runnable interface, which provides a standardized way to interact with all LangChain components [1](#0-0) . This interface pattern ensures that all components (LLMs, Chat Models, Prompts, Retrievers, Tools, Output Parsers) implement common methods like `invoke()`, `batch()`, `stream()`, etc.

### 2. **Strategy Pattern**

LangChain uses the strategy pattern extensively for model abstractions. The framework provides base interfaces like `BaseChatModel` and `BaseLLM` that are implemented by provider-specific classes [2](#0-1) . This allows easy switching between different LLM providers while maintaining the same interface.

### 3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

The chain pattern is fundamental to LangChain's architecture [3](#0-2) . Chains represent sequences of calls to components where outputs from one step become inputs to the next step, implementing a clear chain of responsibility for processing data through multiple stages.

### 4. **Composition Pattern**

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) implements a composition pattern that allows building complex pipelines from simpler components [4](#0-3) . Components can be composed using the pipe operator (`|`) to create declarative sequences.

### 5. **Factory Pattern**

The framework uses factory patterns for creating retrievers and other components. For example, vector stores can be converted to retrievers using the `as_retriever()` method [5](#0-4) .

### 6. **Observer Pattern**

LangChain implements an observer pattern through its callback system, allowing components to emit events that can be observed for logging, monitoring, and streaming purposes [6](#0-5) .

### 7. **Template Method Pattern**

The base `Chain` class demonstrates the template method pattern, defining the overall algorithm structure while allowing subclasses to implement specific steps like `_call()` and `_acall()` methods.

### 8. **Adapter Pattern**

LangChain uses adapter patterns to integrate with various third-party services and APIs, providing a unified interface regardless of the underlying provider's specific API structure.

## Architectural Patterns

### Modular Architecture

The framework follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns across packages [7](#0-6) :

- `langchain-core`: Base abstractions and interfaces
- `langchain`: High-level chains and agents  
- `langchain-community`: Third-party integrations
- Provider-specific packages: Individual packages for major providers

### Plugin Architecture

The integration system follows a plugin architecture where new providers can be added by implementing the required interfaces without modifying core framework code.

## Notes

These design patterns work together to create LangChain's key value propositions: standardized interfaces, composability, and extensibility. The Runnable interface serves as the foundation that enables all other patterns to work cohesively, while LCEL provides the declarative syntax for composing these patterns into complex applications.

# Pydantic AI

Based on the codebase context, you're asking about the design patterns used in PydanticAI, which is an agent framework for building production-grade generative AI applications.

## Design Patterns in PydanticAI

PydanticAI implements several key design patterns throughout its architecture:

### 1. **Strategy Pattern**
The model abstraction layer uses the Strategy pattern to provide interchangeable LLM providers. [1](#0-0)  Each model implementation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) implements the same `Model` interface, allowing agents to switch between providers without code changes.

### 2. **Dependency Injection Pattern**
PydanticAI extensively uses dependency injection through the `RunContext` system. [2](#0-1)  Dependencies are passed to system prompts, tools, and output validators via the `RunContext` parameter, enabling testability and customization. [3](#0-2) 

### 3. **Decorator Pattern**
The framework uses decorators extensively for registering components:
- `@agent.tool` for function tools [4](#0-3) 
- `@agent.system_prompt` for dynamic system prompts [5](#0-4) 
- `@agent.output_validator` for output validation [6](#0-5) 

### 4. **Builder Pattern**
The `Agent` class acts as a builder, allowing configuration of models, dependencies, tools, and system prompts before execution. [7](#0-6) 

### 5. **State Machine Pattern**
The graph execution system implements a state machine pattern through the `pydantic-graph` package. [8](#0-7)  Nodes represent states and edges represent transitions in complex workflows.

### 6. **Template Method Pattern**
The agent execution flow follows a template method pattern where the overall algorithm is defined but specific steps can be customized. [9](#0-8)  The `UserPromptNode.run()` method defines the template for processing user prompts.

### 7. **Observer Pattern**
The streaming system uses an observer-like pattern where events are yielded during execution. [10](#0-9)  Components can observe and react to different types of events during model responses.

### 8. **Wrapper Pattern**
Model wrappers like `FallbackModel`, `InstrumentedModel`, and `TestModel` use the wrapper pattern to add behavior to existing models. [11](#0-10) 

### 9. **Generic Programming Pattern**
The `Agent` class is generic over dependency and output types, providing compile-time type safety. [12](#0-11)  This ensures type checking throughout the application.

## Notes

The design patterns work together to create a flexible, type-safe framework. The Strategy pattern enables model portability, Dependency Injection supports testing, and the State Machine pattern handles complex workflows. The extensive use of generics and decorators provides both type safety and ergonomic APIs, following the "FastAPI feeling" design philosophy mentioned in the documentation.
