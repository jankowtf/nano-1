# Nanobricks as an SDK - Scratchpad

## Core Value Proposition as SDK

Nanobricks should be positioned as **"The SDK for building composable, production-ready Python systems"**

### Why Developers Need This

1. **Problem**: Building larger systems often leads to:
   - Monolithic code that's hard to test
   - Tight coupling between components
   - Difficulty adding features without breaking existing code
   - Complex deployment and scaling challenges

2. **Solution**: Nanobricks provides:
   - Atomic, self-contained components
   - Standardized interfaces for composition
   - Built-in production features (monitoring, deployment, security)
   - Progressive enhancement through skills

## SDK Use Cases to Highlight

### 1. Database Access Layer
```python
# Build a complete DB layer from nanobricks
user_repo = (
    ValidateInput(UserSchema)
    | SanitizeSQL()
    | QueryBuilder()
    | DatabaseExecutor()
    | ResultMapper(User)
).with_skill("cache").with_skill("observability")
```

### 2. API Gateway
```python
# Compose an API gateway
api_gateway = (
    RateLimiter()
    | Authenticator()
    | RequestValidator()
    | RouteDispatcher()
    | ResponseTransformer()
).with_skill("api").with_skill("logging")
```

### 3. Data Pipeline
```python
# ETL pipeline
etl_pipeline = (
    S3Loader()
    | CSVParser()
    | DataValidator()
    | Transformer()
    | Aggregator()
    | DatabaseWriter()
).with_skill("monitoring").with_skill("retry")
```

### 4. Microservice Template
```python
# Complete microservice
microservice = create_microservice(
    name="order-service",
    bricks=[
        OrderValidator(),
        InventoryChecker(),
        PaymentProcessor(),
        OrderFulfiller()
    ],
    skills=["api", "cli", "docker", "kubernetes", "observability"]
)
```

## Key SDK Features to Emphasize

1. **Composition Over Inheritance**
   - Show how to build complex systems from simple bricks
   - Demonstrate various composition patterns

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start simple, add capabilities as needed
   - Skills system for cross-cutting concerns

3. **Production-Ready Components**
   - Every brick can be monitored, deployed, secured
   - Built-in best practices

4. **Type Safety**
   - Full type inference through pipelines
   - Runtime validation with beartype

5. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Test individual bricks in isolation
   - Debug pipelines step-by-step
   - Performance profiling built-in
