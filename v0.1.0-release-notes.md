# v0.1.0 Release Notes - Version Reset

**Release Date**: June 9, 2025

## 🔄 Version Reset Notice

We are resetting our version numbering from v0.2.5 back to v0.1.0. This is not a regression but a strategic decision to:

1. **Adopt Atomic Development**: Shift focus from version-based milestones to atomic commit-based development
2. **Reflect True Maturity**: More accurately represent the framework's current state
3. **Improve Semantic Versioning**: Better align with SemVer principles for future releases

**Important**: All functionality from versions 0.1.1 through 0.2.5 is included in this v0.1.0 release.

## 💔 Breaking Changes

None. This is a version number reset only - all APIs remain compatible.

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

If you're currently using Nanobricks v0.2.x:

```toml
# Update your dependency specification
# Old
nanobricks = "^0.2.5"

# New
nanobricks = "^0.1.0"
```

No code changes are required - all APIs remain compatible.

### For Contributors

We now use atomic commits and git worktrees:

```bash
# Create a worktree for your feature
task worktree:create FEATURE=my-feature PURPOSE="Add awesome feature"

# Make atomic commits
task worktree:atomic:commit FEATURE=my-feature MESSAGE="feat: add specific improvement"

# Integrate within 48 hours
task worktree:integrate:create-pr FEATURE=my-feature
```

## 📊 Development Philosophy

Moving forward, we embrace:

- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit is a complete, reversible change
- **Continuous Integration**: No more waiting for version milestones
- **Rapid Iteration**: Features ship when ready, not by schedule
- **Community-Driven**: Your atomic contributions shape the framework
