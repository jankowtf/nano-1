## Overview

The Nanobricks implementation follows a phased approach, prioritizing core functionality before advanced features.

## Phase 1: Core Framework (Week 1-2)

### Milestone 1.1: Basic Protocol
- [ ] Define `Nanobrick` protocol with generics
- [ ] Implement `__or__` operator for composition
- [ ] Create basic `invoke()` method
- [ ] Set up `nanobricks-core` package with uv

### Milestone 1.2: Type Safety
- [ ] Integrate beartype for runtime checking
- [ ] Configure mypy for static analysis
- [ ] Create type-safe composition operators
- [ ] Document type patterns

### Milestone 1.3: First Examples
- [ ] Create `ValidatorData` nanobrick
- [ ] Create `DataTransformer` nanobrick
- [ ] Demonstrate basic pipeline
- [ ] Write initial tests

## Phase 2: Skill System (Week 3-4)

### Milestone 2.1: Skill Interface
- [ ] Define `Skill` protocol
- [ ] Implement `enhance()` method
- [ ] Create skill registry
- [ ] Add activation logic

### Milestone 2.2: Core Skills
- [ ] Implement `SkillAPI` (FastAPI)
- [ ] Implement `SkillCLI` (Typer)
- [ ] Implement `SkillUI` (Streamlit)
- [ ] Create examples for each

### Milestone 2.3: Integration Patterns
- [ ] Mount patterns for APIs
- [ ] Command patterns for CLIs
- [ ] Component patterns for UIs
- [ ] Test compositions

## Phase 3: Standard Library (Week 5-6)

### Milestone 3.1: Common Nanobricks
- [ ] Validators (email, phone, etc.)
- [ ] Transformers (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- [ ] Filters (data cleaning)
- [ ] Aggregators (statistics)

### Milestone 3.2: Collections
- [ ] Create `nanobricks-validators`
- [ ] Create `nanobricks-transformers`
- [ ] Create `nanobricks-connectors`
- [ ] Publish to PyPI

## Phase 4: Scaffolding & Tools (Week 7-8)

### Milestone 4.1: Project Generator
- [ ] Create `nanobrick-new` CLI
- [ ] Templates for different brick types
- [ ] go-task automation
- [ ] VS Code integration

### Milestone 4.2: Development Tools
- [ ] Testing framework
- [ ] Documentation generator
- [ ] Type stub generator
- [ ] Performance profiler

## Phase 5: AI Integration (Week 9-10)

### Milestone 5.1: MCP Support
- [ ] MCP server skill
- [ ] Tool/prompt exposure
- [ ] Example AI nanobricks
- [ ] Documentation

### Milestone 5.2: Advanced AI
- [ ] Memory management
- [ ] Reasoning traces
- [ ] Multi-agent support
- [ ] Cost optimization

## Phase 6: Ecosystem (Week 11-12)

### Milestone 6.1: Registry
- [ ] Package registry design
- [ ] Discovery mechanisms
- [ ] Version management
- [ ] Dependency resolution

### Milestone 6.2: Community
- [ ] Example gallery
- [ ] Tutorial series
- [ ] Contribution guide
- [ ] Discord/Slack community

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Type safety: 100% of compositions type-check
- Performance: <1ms overhead per composition
- Test coverage: >90% for core components
- Documentation: All public APIs documented

### Adoption
- 10+ example nanobricks
- 3+ real-world integrations
- Active community contributions
- Positive developer feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Type complexity**: Start simple, add gradually
2. **Performance overhead**: Profile early, optimize later
3. **API stability**: Mark experimental features clearly

### Adoption Risks
1. **Learning curve**: Comprehensive tutorials
2. **Migration path**: From existing code
3. **Ecosystem**: Seed with quality examples

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Create `nanobricks-core` package
3. Implement basic protocol
4. Build first working example

## How to Contribute

- Review and comment on design
- Implement example nanobricks
- Test early versions
- Provide feedback

## Questions for Discussion

1. Should we prioritize breadth or depth?
2. Which skills are most critical?
3. How do we ensure quality standards?
4. What's the MVP for launch?
