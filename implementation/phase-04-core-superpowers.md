# Phase 4: Core Skills Implementation

**Duration**: 1 session  
**Goal**: Implement API, CLI, UI, and logging skills

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Phase 3 completed with skill framework
- [ ] FastAPI, Typer, Streamlit available
- [ ] Loguru installed

## Tasks

### 4.1 API Skill (45 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/api.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillAPI class
- [ ] Generate FastAPI endpoints from nanobrick
- [ ] Add /invoke and /batch endpoints
- [ ] Support OpenAPI documentation
- [ ] Create mounting mechanism

### 4.2 CLI Skill (30 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/cli.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillCLI class
- [ ] Generate Typer commands
- [ ] Add file input/output support
- [ ] Support streaming for large data
- [ ] Create help documentation

### 4.3 UI Skill (30 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/ui.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillUI class
- [ ] Generate Streamlit components
- [ ] Add input validation UI
- [ ] Support different component types
- [ ] Create responsive layouts

### 4.4 Logging Skill (30 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/logging.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillLogging class
- [ ] Configure Loguru per nanobrick
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Support log rotation
- [ ] Create correlation IDs

### 4.5 State Management Skill (45 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/state.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillState class
- [ ] Add Redis backend support
- [ ] Implement state scoping
- [ ] Support TTL and eviction
- [ ] Create state sharing between bricks

## Deliverables

- Working API skill with FastAPI
- CLI skill with Typer
- UI skill with Streamlit
- Logging with Loguru
- State management system

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can expose any nanobrick as REST API
- [ ] Can run nanobricks from command line
- [ ] Can create web UIs automatically
- [ ] Structured logging works per-brick
- [ ] State persists across invocations

## Next Phase Preview

Phase 5 will add:

- Observability (OpenTelemetry)
- Deployment skills (Docker, K8s)
- Advanced composition patterns
- Hot-swapping support
