# Nanobricks Implementation Plan

This directory contains the phased implementation plan for the Nanobricks framework. Each phase is designed to be completed within a single AI coding session, building incrementally toward the full vision.

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Core Protocol & Basic Composition

- Establish foundational protocol
- Implement pipe operator composition
- Create first working examples
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 2: Enhanced Core Features

- Add dependency injection
- Implement contracts & invariants
- Add resource management
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 3: Configuration System & Skill Framework

- TOML-based configuration
- Basic skill system
- Feature flag support
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 4: Core Skills Implementation

- API, CLI, UI skills
- Logging with Loguru
- State management
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Patterns

- Observability (OpenTelemetry)
- Deployment (Docker, K8s)
- Advanced composition patterns
- Hot-swapping
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 6: Standard Library & Developer Tools

- Reusable nanobrick library
- Project scaffolding
- Documentation generator
- Developer experience tools
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 7: AI Integration & Intelligence

- MCP protocol support
- AI reasoning capabilities
- Agent communication
- Adaptive behaviors
- **Duration**: 1 session

### Phase 8: Production Readiness & Ecosystem

- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Package registry
- Community building
- **Duration**: 1 session

## Getting Started

1. Start with Phase 1 to establish the core
2. Each phase builds on the previous
3. Test thoroughly before moving forward
4. Adjust timelines based on progress

## Design Principles

- **Incremental**: Each phase delivers working software
- **Testable**: Every feature has tests
- **Documented**: Code and usage examples included
- **Flexible**: Phases can be adjusted based on learning

## Success Metrics

- Type safety maintained throughout
- Performance targets met (<1ms overhead)
- Developer experience is smooth
- Community adoption grows

## Questions or Adjustments?

This plan is designed to be flexible. If you discover better approaches or need to adjust priorities during implementation, feel free to modify the phases while maintaining the core vision of simple, composable, antifragile components.
