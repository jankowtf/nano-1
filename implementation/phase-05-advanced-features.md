# Phase 5: Advanced Features & Patterns

**Duration**: 1 session  
**Goal**: Add observability, deployment, and advanced composition

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Phase 4 completed with core skills
- [ ] OpenTelemetry understanding
- [ ] Docker/Kubernetes basics

## Tasks

### 5.1 Observability Skill (45 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/observability.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillObservability class
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Support multiple exporters
- [ ] Create trace correlation

### 5.2 Deployment Skills (45 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/skills/deployment.py
```

- [ ] Create SkillDocker class
- [ ] Generate Dockerfile automatically
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Add SkillKubernetes class
- [ ] Generate Helm charts

### 5.3 Advanced Composition Patterns (30 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/patterns.py
```

- [ ] Implement Branch for conditionals
- [ ] Create Parallel for concurrent execution
- [ ] Add FanOut/FanIn patterns
- [ ] Support error recovery patterns
- [ ] Create composition visualizer

### 5.4 Hot-Swapping Support (30 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/hotswap.py
```

- [ ] Create SwappablePipeline class
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime swapping
- [ ] Add gradual rollout support
- [ ] Create swap history tracking
- [ ] Test under load

### 5.5 Performance Optimizations (30 min)

```python
# src/nanobricks/optimizations.py
```

- [ ] Add composition caching
- [ ] Implement pipeline fusion
- [ ] Create batch optimizations
- [ ] Add memory pooling
- [ ] Profile and benchmark

## Deliverables

- Full observability with tracing/metrics
- Docker and Kubernetes support
- Advanced composition patterns
- Hot-swapping capability
- Performance improvements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Distributed tracing works across pipelines
- [ ] Can deploy nanobricks to Docker/K8s
- [ ] Complex branching/parallel flows work
- [ ] Hot-swapping doesn't drop requests
- [ ] <1ms overhead per composition level

## Next Phase Preview

Phase 6 will add:

- Standard library of nanobricks
- Project scaffolding tools
- Documentation generator
- Example gallery
